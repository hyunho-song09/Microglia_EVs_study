# ðŸ§¬ Microglia_EVs_study

This repository contains **R scripts** and **sample data** used for metabolomics and extracellular vesicle (EV) analysis in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, multiple linear regression, and mediation analysis.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project implements:
- **Data Import & Preprocessing**: Reads Excel-based omics datasets.
- **Statistical Testing**: T-tests, ANOVA, normality, and variance tests.
- **Metabolomics Analysis**: Outlier detection, Cliffâ€™s Delta calculation.
- **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**: Identifies relationships between variables.
- **Mediation Analysis**: Explores potential mediators in metabolic pathways.
